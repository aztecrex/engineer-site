# I Like LIke Javascript

Or, _Snapshot Testing For the Win_

This is a follow-on to the original "Adventures in Tech Blogging"
article below. The code for this site is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/aztecrex/engineer-site).


## A Journey Through Darkness

It's late and I'm tired but I just updated the engineer site after
days of working on the code so I need to say _something_.

Conceptually, the latest change was simple. Rather than display
all the articles one-after-t'other on a single page, just display
the latest article and links to all the previous articles. An
expert web developer could have done that in her sleep.

But I am not an expert web developer. Every time I have to visit
Javascript, I'm the professor on Gilligan's Island: inventing a
short-wave radio out of coconuts and trying every conceivable way
to get out of there.

But not this time. I was going to embrace it because Javascript
web development, I was informed, finally makes sense. With React,
Redux, and a bit of glue, I could create an organized, easy-to-test,
just-plain-fun-to-code web application.

## Uneject

At this time, I decided to un-eject the ejected create-react-app.
My new design did not compile articles into the bundle so the need
for a Markdown loader was no more.  I would give CRA a real try and
work hard to go without ejecting.

## Component Organization

The first thing I noticed was that there was no consensus on how to
organize components. You have _unconnected_ components (people call
them dumb but that's just mean). You have _connected_
components (people call them containers). And you have
all kinds of literature claiming that they should be composed in
some strict way, or maybe any old way, just decide on your own.
I had no way to decide, so I just took a naive stab at it.

I started with an idea: I could use a naming convention to distinguish
them. So there would be _Article_ and _ConnectedArticle_, say.
This quickly grew out of hand and as I took stock of the shape, I
realized that it didn't really matter. What _did_ matter was how
they were tested so I stopped all the naming convention nonsense
and focused on just how to unit test these things. Testing the
reducer was super easy. I was able to modularize it, test the
parts, then compose them, yay. I was on my way out of the prototype
phase.

## Ah Enzyme

But I also had a big pile of confused modules with connected and
unconnected components. I'd heard Enzyme was the way to test these
components so I started converting the component prototype pile to a
TDD project using Enzyme.

I may hurt some feelings but Enzyme is, um, disorganized. Its API
needs a shot of cohesive, _STAT_. It is not at all easy to navigate
nodes, for one.  The best I could do was take broad shots at the
expectations. But each rendering kept adding new rules and the
hours were going by and by and by. It also has a different API
depending on how you render (Enzyme just _phones it in_ for
static rendering and says: the API is Cheerios. Wait, what?).

## In Jest

I kept reading that Jest made testing so easy. I was using
Jest so why wasn't it easy?  I decided to tackle Jest from the
ground up and try to align myself with it. The first thing I
learned is that you can't modify much of Jest if you use create-react-app.
I also learned that the CRA folks really don't want us using
Enzyme. They grudgingly leave _jsdom_ in the configuration so
we can use it but they want us to move toward something
called _snapshot testing_.

I could only imagine what that was and my imagination was showing me
horrible scenes of regression tragedy. I was going to write tests
_first_, doggone it, so deal with it.

## C'mon, Just _Try_ It

I came across a project, enzyme-to-json. It was a way to
serialize Enzyme wrappers in a pretty way so they could be
stored and read (by humans) in snapshot files. Hmm. Maybe if I tried
it just one time manually--I won't integrate it into my setup or
anything--I could see what all these people were talking about.
I was sure it wasn't for me but, well, open mind and all that.

## Oh My Good Gravy

You should _never_ try snapshot testing unless you
are prepared for a substantial perspective shift. That one try
opened my eyes to a completely new testing workflow. Instead of
trying to figure out how I wanted to render something, I could
_just render it_.  Incrementally.  So, a component could start
out as, say, a `<div>`. Snapshot that, awesome, test passes.
Next iteration, add some content.  Oops, test fails. But it fails
the way I expect so update the snapshot. Now it's passing.

Snapshot testing lets you _keep moving_. All the myriad details
of rendering are captured in a snapshot. If the tiniest thing
changes, then you know and can decide if it's a regression or
an enhancement.

## So Enzyme Again

Suddenly, Enzyme was redeemed. By using shallow rendering
exclusively, snapshot tests become isolated from changes
in their dependencies. With the wonderful wrapping provided
by enzyme-to-json, my shallow snapshots were a joy to read
and tests were a breeze.

Because the shallow rendering doesn't show the names of
components declared in the functional style, I started
revisiting all of them and changing them to `React.Component`
inheritance style. Not as sexy but now my snapshots were
giving me great information.

## New Packaging model

Because my test flow was getting so fast, I quickly iterated
over a packaging style that, at this point, is best for the
way way I think about component composition.

Unconnected components are simple, I just export them as
the default for their modules. I can easily test them with
their props directly, even if they contain connected
components (because of shallow rendering).

For connected components, I export them like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
//...

class Noodle extends React.Component {
  render() {
  // ...
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  // ...
};

const mappedActions = {/*...*/};

export {Noodle, mapStatetoProps};
export default connect(mapStateToProps,mappedActions)(Noodle);
```

Now in my tests, I have three sections. One to test the
unconnected component, one to test the state mapping, and
one to test the connected component.  For the unconnected,
testing is simply shallow rendering with direct props. For
the connected component, shallow rendering with a mock store
is all that's needed unless it emits actions. In that case,
I have to do a mount rendering.  For the state mapping, it's
just pure function testing.

## What Else Is It Good For?

I am wondering if there are other traditional testing scenarios,
other than React, that could benefit from snapshot testing.
I'll probably try it on some server-side code to see what
the limits are.  It's certainly not for everything. It doesn't
seem to guide me on system structure like normal TDD but
we'll see.

So I am no longer trying to leave Javascript Island. I even _like_
Javasript, maybe even _like like_. I'm keeping an open mind.
