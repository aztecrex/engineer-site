    Type: String
    # this is so dumb. AWS won't allow us to create an OAI from within
    # a CF template. So we have to provide one. This is a temporary workaround.
    # Eventually we should create a custom resource to either create these
    # things or at least retrieve the ids from a (encrypted, yes) configuration
    # store.
    # This one corresponds to OAI E3DIS3913OEPXE
    Default: 1b4f36734d90d4b10a51e6ab9ff5542ed26706ca309e844f48f5e43764acec0bf20a8c12a2143c81aaecd7f5ac285f0c
    Description: >
      An origin access principal. These cannot be created through
      cloudformation so create one before you get here or, if you are me, use
      this handy default.
