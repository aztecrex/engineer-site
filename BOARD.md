## Backlog

### Epic: Site Workflow More

* article staging
  * commit articles in progress without them being on the main index
  * easy way to read articles in progress
* article queue
  * articles wait for publish date to show
* revision comes from git hash


### Epic: Look and Feel

* article navigation to one side
* article styling
* colors
* fonts


### No Epic

* try Yarn!
* collect entries into series
* custom resource for OAI
* custom resource for non-route-53 domains
* custom resource for bucket that can be deleted with content
* decouple from my own site so anyone can quickly and easily use this
project as a starting point
* file assets
* twitter integration
* youtube integration
* test drive AWS provisioning, is that possible?
